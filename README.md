# PPRS Lab Simulation
gz sim (gazebo sim) (gazebo harmonic - ros2 jazzy)

# setup steps:
1. place the initial positions config file `xarm6_default_kinematics.yaml` in `xarm_description/config/kinematics/default/`. rename the existing file.

agenda

2. plugin for vacuum gripper (write one or find one)
3. objects to pick in gazebo
4. objects to pick reported to rviz
5. sensor to see ojects in gazebo -> reporting to rviz
6. plan visualization in rviz
7. xarm planner?
8. plansys2
9. raspberry pi rviz

10. add pprs bin model into simulation instead of fuel model
11. make realsense sit in realistic location
